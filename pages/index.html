    <h2>Our Story</h2>
    <p>Nick and Mandy met in high school &mdash; though they didn't date back then. They both liked each other, but didn't act on it being foolish young teenagers.</p>
    <p>Nick was a year ahead of Mandy, but she ended up going to the same college as him. They struck up a few conversations and went to more than a few parties together. They made it "facebook official" in 2010, shortly before Nick deleted his Facebook. He now uses Mandy to keep in contact with everyone.</p>
    <p>The relationship held strong through over 20 months of studying abroad and remote work over the the next few years. After college, they moved in together and have lived together since. Over the years a lot has changed for them &mdash; they've had a few roommates, moved cities, changed jobs, and picked up a couple of pets. The only 'constant' for each of them was the other &mdash; and they'd like to keep it that way. So after 6 years they're finally getting married!</p>

    <h2>More Info</h2>

      <h3>Attire</h3>
      <p>We're thrilled to have you no matter your dress! But if you'd like some guidance, dressy-casual or cocktail attire is perfect. The ceremony and reception will both take place on grass, so keep that in mind when choosing your footwear. It will likely be warm and sunny (don't forget your sunglasses!) but could potentially get a little chilly on the water when the sun goes down.</p>

    <section>
      <h3>Parking</h3>
      <p>Ideally, there will be parking right at the wedding venue in a lot adjacent to the property, but we're still working out the details. If this lot is not available, we will have parking attendants and/or a valet service. Either way, simply drive to 4101 Duke Dr and someone will direct you where to go!</p>
